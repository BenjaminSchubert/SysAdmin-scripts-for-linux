PyDuplicate
=============

Usage
------------

    pyDuplicate.py folder1 folder2 etc
    pyDuplicate.py --help to see all options
    
Infos
------------
This is currently a work in progress. For now, the only thing this script will do is return a list of lists containing each a double.

RoadMap
------------
 - create basic exclusion for special cases (locks)
 - allow to take action after the list is created
 - handle case when a file is deleted while being treated
 - Correct problem where infos are sent on stderr
